+					are new mediators introduced in Apache Synapse 3.0. <a href="mediators.html#Respond">Respond</a> provides
+					a mechanism to send a message back to the client as a response. In older versions of Apache Synapse
+					we would use the <a href="mediators.html#Send">Send</a> mediator to respond back to a client either
+					after a message is received from a backend in an out sequence or force a response back to the client
+					using a series of mediators as follows:
+				</p>

+&lt;send/&gt;
+					</div>
+				<p>
+					We can replace above methods with the <a href="mediators.html#Respond">Respond</a> mediator anywhere
+					in the mediation flow to respond back to the client with the current message. Any mediators residing
+					after the <a href="mediators.html#Respond">Respond</a> mediator will be ignored.
+				</p>
+
+				<p>Similarly the <a href="mediators.html#Loopback">Loopback</a> mediator is used to jump the flow from
+				an in sequence to the out sequence ignoring any mediators residing after the
